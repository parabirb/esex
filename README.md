# esex (enabling secure encryption x)
## rationale
discord is a terrible company staffed by terrible people. do you want your data in their hands?? probably not. sadly, nearly every plugin for end-to-encryption on discord is either deprecated (looking at you, DiscordCrypt), using broken algorithms (who the fuck chooses SIDH??), or unmaintained.

yeah. not the greatest situation. worry not, because esex is here. esex isn't perfect, but it does the job. you will need betterdiscord to use esex (sorry if you don't vibe with it).

## goals
esex's goal is to implement secure end-to-end encryption in one-on-one DMs (no group messaging, sorry) with perfect forward secrecy.
